# pylabview-helpers
Helpers for using the pylabview library programatically.  

pylabview was mostly designed for use through its entrypoints and I want to use it programatically.  Most of this stuff can probably be mainlined to pylabview once I come to a stable API.

pylabview-helpers may use internal APIs of pylabview and accepts that pylabview changes might break it.  This library can lock down on versions if needed.
